    "\n",
    "- To utlize machine learning and statistical models to predict the trend of COVID-19 cases / deaths.\n",
    "- Develop a simple interactive dashboard based on the analysis you have done so far. We will be utilizing Plotly (https://plotly.com/)\n",

    "# Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: (20%)\n",
    "- Team: \n",
    "    - Develop Linear and Non-Linear (polynomial) regression models for predicting cases and deaths in US. \n",
    "        - Start your data from the first day of infections in US. X-Axis - number of days since the first case, Y-Axis - number of new cases and deaths.\n",
    "        - Calculate and report Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for your models (linear and non-linear). \n",
    "        - Discuss bias versus variance tradeoff.\n",
    "        - Describe the trends as compared to other countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Member: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Utilize Linear and Non-Linear (polynomial) regression models to compare trends for a single state and its counties (top 5 with highest number of cases). Start your data from the first day of infections. \n",
    "        - X-Axis - number of days since the first case, Y - Axis number of new cases and deaths. Calcluate error using RMSE.\n",
    "        - Identify which counties are most at risk. Model for top 5 counties with cases within a state and describe their trends.\n",
    " \n",
    "     - Perform hypothesis tests on questions identified in Stage II. (Can determine new questions as well)\n",
    "        - e.x. *Does higher employment data (overall employment numbers) lead to higher covid case numbers or more rapid increase in covid cases.*. Here you would compare the covid cases to the state or county level enrichment data to prove or disprove your null hypothesis. In this case there will be a two tail - two sample t-test to see if there is a difference and then one-tail - two sample t-test to show higher or lower.\n",
    "        - Depending on your type of data you can also perform Chi-square test for categorical hypothesis testing. \n",

    "    \n",
    "## Task 2:(35%) \n",
    "- Member: \n",
    "    - For each of the Member analyses plot graphs\n",
    "        - trend line\n",
    "        - confidence intervals (error in prediction)\n",
    "        - prediction path (forecast)\n",

    "## Task 3: (%35) \n",
    "- Team:\n",
    "    - Plotly:\n",
    "        - Incorporate your best model prediction trend line - Linear / Non-Linear. \n",
    "        - Ex: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus\n",
    "        - Plot the trend line using moving average (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average).\n",
    "        - Use 7-day rolling average. (10)\n",
    "    - Map \n",
    "        - Show US map of cases or deaths (normalized by population). Entire US with county level information. Use mean of county population to normalize for cases and deaths. (10)\n",
