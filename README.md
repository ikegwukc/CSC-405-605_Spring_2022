## Course Description

In a world with ever increasing data generated both by humans and machines alike, the field of computer science has seen a transition from computation-intensive solutions to data-intensive ones. Often in such a scenario, solutions to real-world problems can be derived/learned by analyzing disparate, complex and messy datasets using Data Science methods and approaches.

This course is highly interactive, and will explore the theories, techniques, and the tools necessary to gain insights from such datasets. Using a problem-based learning philosophy, students are expected to make use of such technologies to design data solutions that can process and analyze real-world datasets for a variety of scientific, social, and environmental challenges.

The core topics addressed by the course will be:

- Programming with Data
- Data Mining, Munging, Wrangling
- Statistics, Analytics, Representation, Visualization
- Introduction to Applied Machine-Learning

## Prerequisites
CSC 339 (Programming Languages) OR Programming experience (Instructor Permission Required)

## Textbooks
There is no required text for the course. Relevant Articles and publicly avaiable books will be available for download. Class slides will also be available for download.

## Course Overview
This course is highly interactive and based on the problem-based learning philosophy; students are expected to make use of said technologies to design highly scalable systems that can process and analyze real-world datasets for a variety of scientific, social, and environmental challenges.

	- https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/CSC-405-605_Fall_2021/tree/master/Project

	The final project of the class will focus on the end to end development of an analytical model. The project will be split into four stages:
	- Stage I Data/Project Understanding,
	- Stage II  (Exploratory Data Analysis),
	- Stage III Basic Machine Learning, and
	- Stage IV Visualization and Dashboard.

	This will be a team-based effort, where in first week of the course the students split into teams of 4-5 students. After completing each stage, the teams will have to give a short presentation (3-5 mins) and a report (1 page) of their progress with the project. The projects will be open-source and the teams will have to use GitHub as their code repository. Upon completion of the project the teams will present their software along with the results in form of a presentation (20 minutes).

    1.  Each Stage of the Final Project has 100 points. They will be equally weighted for the project final score.
    	1. Each stage has deliverables of:
    		1. Report
    		2. Code Jupyter/IPython Notebooks
    		3. Presentation
    	1. To get the full points in each stage you need to finish all of the deliverables.

	- Your code and documentation will reside in a ***project repository***.
	- The structure of the repository should be maintained as such.
		- /src - code and notebooks
			- /team
				- /stage_X
			- /member
				- /{member_name}
					- /stage_X
		- /data - data folder for the repository
			- /stage_X
		- /utility - utility or scripts
		- /doc - documentation - project reports and presentations
		- README.md - Description of project, deliverables, team members (see Stage I for details)
		- **all src files (notebooks) should use relative path.**
	- Each project has separate deliverables - notebooks need to be updated into the repository for grading. We will grade the status of repository at the time of deadline.
	- Each team makes a ***recorded presentation*** of their project stage and uploads it to canvas. Top presentations will be discussed in class.
	- No collaboration on member tasks.


### Communication

Discord channel for class discussions and team creation: https://discord.gg/N2rhnw7h3J. The channel should be used for discussing general questions related to assignments and projects. Use this channel to ask questions and find anwsers to already responded quesitons. If the question has been already answered in the channel, I will not be responding to emails. Emails are a one-to-one conversation which takes a lot of time hence the channel is there to broadcast information and have more community oriented discussion. Do not share code or screenshots of code in the channel. Email should be the last step and can be used to ask student specific questions.


### Presentation Pointers
- You are going to be reviewed on the following criterion:
  - Criterion 1 (**C1**): Organize/Create information/slides in a manner appropriate for the intended audience
  - Criterion 2 (**C2**): Deliver information in a manner appropriate for the intended audience
  - Criterion 3 (**C3**): Relate to the intended audience
- For each criterion the evaluations/scoring are based on (higher the better):
  - **4 - Exceeds Criteria:** Excellent organization; information is well organized. Clear introduction; main points well stated and argued, with smooth transition to next point. Clear summary and conclusion.
  - **3 - Meets Criteria:** Satisfactory organization; clear introduction; main points are well stated; some transitions are somewhat sudden. Clear conclusion.
  - **2 - Progressing to Criteria:** Information is somewhat organized. Audience may have difficulty following presentation in areas.
  - **1 - Below Expectations:** Presentation is unorganized. Introduction unclear. Audience has difficulty following presentation. Presentation contains abrupt jumps; some of the main points and conclusion are unclear.


### Project Teams:

**Note**: Teams along with Team repostories will be listed here.

## Academic Honesty Policy

The instructor will deal strictly with any violations of academic honesty and integrity in this course. See Academic Integrity Policy ([Link](https://osrr.uncg.edu/academic-integrity/)).  for more details. ***Absolutely no discussion, collaboration, copying, and sharing on assignments. This includes coping from the internet. Any student who violates this policy will receive “F” in the course. The instructor will report the case to the university.***

## Attendance Policy
Attendance is required for all the class meetings. If you will be absent for any class it is your responsibility to catch up on class materials.


## Special Needs and/or Disabilities
Students with disabilities should have documentation from the Office of Accessibility Resources & Services ([Link](https://ods.uncg.edu/)). This documentation should be provided to the instructor for review. In the case of major provisions such as separate testing environment or test-readers, the student must make arrangements with Office of Accessibility Resources & Services so that suitable accommodations can be provided.

## COVID Statement

As we return for spring 2022, the campus community must recognize and address continuing concerns about physical and emotional safety, especially as we will have many more students, faculty, and staff on campus than in the last academic year. As such, all students, faculty, and staff are required to uphold UNCG’s culture of care by actively engaging in behaviors that limit the spread of COVID-19. Such actions include, but are not limited to, the following:



- Following face-covering guidelines [Link](https://update.uncg.edu/community-standards/)
- Engaging in proper hand-washing hygiene when possible
- Self-monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19
- Staying home if you are ill
- Complying with directions from health care providers or public health officials to quarantine or isolate if ill or exposed to someone who is ill.



Instructors will have seating charts for their classes. These are important for facilitating contact tracing should there be a confirmed case of COVID-19. Students must sit in their assigned seats at every class meeting and must not move furniture. Students should not eat or drink during class time.



To make it easier for students to hear their instructor and/or read lips and if conditions permit, instructors who are fully vaccinated and who can maintain at least six feet of distance from students may remove their masks while actively teaching if they choose, but will wear a mask at all other times while in the classroom, including during the periods before and after class



A limited number of disposable masks will be available in classrooms for students who have forgotten theirs. Face coverings will also be available for purchase in the UNCG Campus Bookstore. Students who do not follow masking requirements will be asked to put on a face covering or leave the classroom to retrieve one and only return when they follow the basic requirements to uphold standards of safety and care for the UNCG community. Once students have a face covering, they are permitted to re-enter a class already in progress. Repeated issues may result in conduct action. The course policies regarding attendance and academics remain in effect for partial or full absence from class due to lack of adherence with face covering and other requirements.



For instances where the Office of Accessibility Resources and Services (OARS) has granted accommodations regarding wearing face coverings, students should contact their instructors to develop appropriate alternatives to class participation and/or activities as needed. Instructors or the student may also contact OARS (336.334.5440) who, in consultation with Student Health

Services, will review requests for accommodations.
